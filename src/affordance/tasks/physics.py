We are given the mass of the car, the velocity of the car, and the coefficient of friction. We are looking for the minimum friction force.
The formula we are looking for is F = μ * N.
In order to compute normal reaction, we need to use the formula for force given mass and acceleration due to gravity. We should use the formula F = m * a

A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to find the amount of work done by the motor. We can use the equation W = F * d, where W is work, F is force, and d is distance. We know the force (it's just the weight of the object being lifted), and we know the distance (it's 4.0 m).
The weight of the object being lifted F = m * g.
So the final formula for work is W = m * g * h

The best answer choice is U = m * g * h

First, we need to figure out what quantity we're trying to solve for. In this case, it's the charge on the oil droplet.
Next, we need to identify which formula would be most useful for solving for that quantity. In this case, it's the formula for electric force, which is equal to the charge on an object times the electric field strength.
So, we can solve for the charge on the oil droplet by plugging in the given values for the electric field strength and the weight of the oil droplet, and solving for q.

  choice: F = m * a
  choice: dq = ρ * dV
  choice: E = q * σ / (2 * ε)
  choice: P = dE / dt
The final answer should be one of the choices.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to calculate the force required to keep the car moving at 20 m/s. We can use the equation F = ma for this. We know the mass of the car (1200 kg) and the acceleration (20 m/s), so we just need to solve for F.
F = 1200 kg * 20 m/s
F = 24000 kg * m/s^2
Now that we know the force required to keep the car moving, we need to calculate the friction force. We know that the friction force is equal to the coefficient of friction times the normal force. Since this is a flat surface, the normal force is just equal to the weight of the car. We also know the coefficient of friction (0.65). So we just need to solve for the friction force.
Friction force = 0.65 * weight of the car
Friction force = 0.65 * (1200 kg * 9.8 m/s^2)
Friction force = 7824 N

The best answer choice is F = m * a.

  choice: q = Q * dθ / π
The final answer should be one of the choices.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

We want to find the object's momentum, so we'll need a formula that includes both mass and velocity. That narrows it down to either p = m * v or v = v_0 + a * t.
But since we're only given the object's velocity and not its acceleration, we'll use p = m * v.

The best answer choice is p = m * v.

The final answer should be one of the choices.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

What are we trying to find? The efficiency of the motor.
What formula would give us efficiency?
Efficiency = work output / work input
For work output, we can use the formula:
Work output = force * distance

Work input = power * time
