# A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations.
# ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd
# MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd
# An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence. Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?

# Next, we need to compute C * (A + B). We can do this in two steps as well: first, we load C into the accumulator, then we multiply it by (A + B).
# Now we need to compute (D + E). We can do this in two steps: first, we load D into the accumulator, then we add E to it.
# Finally, we need to compute F * (D + E). We can do this in two steps: first, we load F into the accumulator, then we multiply it by (D + E).

# Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?
# A) 1/50
# B) 1/27
# C) 1/25
# D) 2/27
# A: Let's think step-by-step.

# We're given that each instruction requires 2 memory references, on average. We're also given that cache misses occur on 1% of references, on average.
# This means that, on average, each instruction will result in 1 cache miss.
# We're told that when a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss.
# This means that, on average, each cache miss will result in the processor being delayed for an additional 1,000 nanoseconds.
# We're told that each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache.
# This means that, on average, each processor can execute 2 instructions per second.
# We're asked to find the proportion of the capacity of the bus that a single processor would consume.
# This means we need to find the average number of instructions that a single processor can execute per second, taking into account the delays due to cache misses.
# We can do this by multiplying the average number of instructions that a single processor can execute per second (2) by the average number of cache misses per instruction (1%).
# This gives us an average of 0.02 instructions per second that a single processor can execute, taking into account the delays due to cache misses.
# This means that a single processor would consume 1/50 of the capacity of the bus.

# B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.
# C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.
# D) It would be the same no matter where you are.
# A: Let's think step-by-step.

# First, we need to understand what it means to "accelerate." In physics, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. So, if we want to accelerate the truck, we need to increase its velocity.
# Now, let's think about what factors would affect the truck's velocity. One factor is the truck's mass. If the truck has more mass, it will be harder to accelerate because it takes more force to move a more massive object. Another factor is gravity. If the truck is on a planet with more gravity, it will be harder to accelerate because the force of gravity will be pulling the truck down.
# So, on Mars, the truck would have less mass than on Earth, but it would also be subject to more gravity. These two factors would cancel each other out, and the truck would accelerate at the same rate no matter where it is.

# A) 10000 times more
# B) 100 times more
# C) 1000 times more
# D) 10 times more
# A: Let's think step-by-step.

# The area of the pupil of the eye is:

# A = πr2
# A = π(5 mm)2
# A = 78.54 mm2

# The area of the telescope's aperture is:

# A = πr2
# A = π(50 cm)2
# A = 1963.5 cm2

# The ratio of the two areas is:

# Aeye/Atelescope = 78.54 mm2/1963.5 cm2
# Aeye/Atelescope = 0.04 mm2/cm2

# Now we can find out how much more light the telescope can gather than the eye. We just need to take the inverse of the ratio of the two areas:

# Atelescope/Aeye = 1/(Aeye/Atelescope)
# Atelescope/Aeye = 1/(0.04 mm2/cm2)
# Atelescope/Aeye = 25 cm2/mm2

Why are parvoviruses a highly impactful parasite?
A) Because they have no nucleic acid
B) They require a helper virus
C) Only replicate in dividing cells
D) Can integrate into host chromosomes
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, what are viruses? They are tiny infectious particles that can replicate only inside the living cells of an organism.

Second, what are the three main types of viruses?
-Bacteria-infecting viruses (bacteriophages)
-Plant-infecting viruses
-Animal-infecting viruses

Third, what are the four main types of animal-infecting viruses?
-Retroviruses
-Herpesviruses
-Coronaviruses
-Parvoviruses

Fourth, what is the difference between a retrovirus and a parvovirus?
-Retroviruses are RNA viruses that use reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA into DNA. This DNA then integrates into the host cell's genome.
-Parvoviruses are DNA viruses that only replicate in dividing cells. They do not integrate into the host cell's genome.

So, why are parvoviruses a highly impactful parasite?
The answer is C: They only replicate in dividing cells.
Since parvoviruses only replicate in dividing cells, they can easily infect and kill cells that are rapidly dividing, such as cancer cells. This makes them a highly impactful parasite.

C) Seronegatives
D) High-risk seronegatives
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The median survival time to AIDS and death was established by following:

A) Seroprevalent HIV-infected individuals
This means that the researchers looked at a group of people who were already infected with HIV and tracked how long they lived. The median is the middle value, so this would give them an idea of how long, on average, people with HIV live.

B) Seroconverters
This means that the researchers looked at a group of people who became infected with HIV and tracked how long they lived. This would give them an idea of how long, on average, people live after becoming infected with HIV.

C) Seronegatives
This means that the researchers looked at a group of people who did not have HIV and tracked how long they lived. This would give them an idea of how long, on average, people without HIV live.

D) High-risk seronegatives
This means that the researchers looked at a group of people who did not have HIV but were at high risk for becoming infected (for example, they may have been exposed to the virus or have a weakened immune system). This would give them an idea of how long, on average, people without HIV live when they are at high risk for infection.

# # The second step is to look at the remaining options and see if we can eliminate any based on what we know. In this case, we can eliminate option C) because it is not related to outsourcing.
# # This leaves us with option A) as the correct answer.

# # Which one of the following items is an example of nonmaterial culture?
# # A) Dove soap
# # B) Dove candy bar
# # C) Dove symbol
# # D) A dove (bird)
# # A: Let's think step-by-step.

# # First, we need to understand what nonmaterial culture is. Nonmaterial culture refers to the nonphysical things that people believe, think, and feel. This includes things like language, religion, and values.

# # Now that we know that, we can look at the answer choices and see which one best fits the definition of nonmaterial culture.

# # A) Dove soap - This is a physical object and does not fit the definition of nonmaterial culture.
# # B) Dove candy bar - This is a physical object and does not fit the definition of nonmaterial culture.
# # C) Dove symbol - This could possibly be an example of nonmaterial culture, as it is something that people believe in or think about.
# # D) A dove (bird) - This is a physical object and does not fit the definition of nonmaterial culture.
# # The best answer choice is C) Dove symbol.

# Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)
# A) 3
# B) 15
# C) 6
# D) 5
# A: Let's think step-by-step.

# There are 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 420 seconds in a 7-minute dance.
# The red light blinks every 2 seconds, so it will blink 210 times during the dance.
# The yellow light blinks every 3 seconds, so it will blink 140 times during the dance.
# The blue light blinks every 5 seconds, so it will blink 84 times during the dance.
# Now, we just need to find how many times 210, 140, and 84 will all be equal to each other. We can do this by finding the greatest common factor of 210, 140, and 84.
# The greatest common factor of 210, 140, and 84 is 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.
# This means that all three lights will be on together 30 times during the dance.

# Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\$300$ to grow to $\$9600$?
# A) 12
# B) 1
# C) 30
# D) 5
# A: Let's think step-by-step.

# We know that $5000 \times (1 + x\%)^6 = 10000$.

# We also know that $300 \times (1 + x\%)^n = 9600$.

# We can set these two equations equal to each other and solve for $n$:

# $5000 \times (1 + x\%)^6 = 10000$
# $300 \times (1 + x\%)^n = 9600$

# $(1 + x\%)^6 = \frac{10000}{5000}$
# $(1 + x\%)^n = \frac{9600}{300}$

# $(1 + x\%)^6 = 2$
# $(1 + x\%)^n = \frac{32}{5}$

# $6 = n$

# Therefore, it will take 6 years for $\$300$ to grow to $\$9600$ at the same interest rate.

# The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\frac{1}{2}$?
# A) -1
# B) 16
# C) -\frac{1}{256}
# D) \frac{1}{16}
# A: Let's think step-by-step.

# We know that $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, so we can write $x = ky^2$ for some constant $k$.

# Similarly, we know that $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$, so we can write $y = mz^3$ for some constant $m$.

# Now, we can plug these expressions for $x$ and $y$ into our original equation to get:

# $$x = ky^2 = k(mz^3)^2 = km^2z^6$$

# We know that when $z = 2$, $x = -16$, so we can plug this into our equation to get:

# $$-16 = km^2(2)^6 \Rightarrow k = \frac{-16}{m^2(2)^6}$$

# Now that we have our value for $k$, we can plug it back into our expression for $x$ to get:

# $$x = \frac{-16}{m^2(2)^6}m^2z^6 = \frac{-16}{(2)^6}z^6 = \frac{-1}{2^6}z^6$$

# Finally, we can plug in $z = \frac{1}{2}$ to get:

# $$x = \frac{-1}{2^6}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{-1}{2^{12}} = \frac{-1}{4096}$$
