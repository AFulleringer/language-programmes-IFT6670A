Anachronisms

Anachronisms: An anachronism is a mistake in chronology, or a person, thing, or event that is out of its proper time. Figure out whether a sentence contains anachronisms or not, and answer 'Yes' or 'No'.
President Syngman Rhee sent a letter commending Hugo Chavez's election victory.
The final answer is either "Yes" or "No".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to identify the person, thing, or event that is out of its proper time. In this sentence, it's President Syngman Rhee. He's out of his proper time because he's from the past.

Next, we need to determine whether the sentence contains a mistake in chronology. In this sentence, there is no mistake in chronology.

Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

President Woodrow Wilson rallied Americans to support the U.S. joining the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The final answer is either "Yes" or "No".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we have to determine whether the sentence contains a mistake in chronology. In other words, are there any events, people, or things that are out of their proper time?

The sentence mentions President Woodrow Wilson, who was in office from 1913 to 1921. It also mentions the International Atomic Energy Agency, which was founded in 1957.

So, there is a mistake in chronology here. President Wilson could not have rallied Americans to support the U.S. joining the International Atomic Energy Agency, because the Agency didn't exist yet!

Therefore, the answer is "Yes".

The T. rex was running toward the herd of Wagyu cattle grazing outside.
The final answer is either "Yes" or "No".
A: Let's think step-by-step.
First, we have the T. rex. This creature lived during the Cretaceous period, which means it's definitely not an anachronism.
Next, we have the Wagyu cattle. These cattle were first bred in Japan in the early 1800s, which means they're also not an anachronism.

However, the sentence mentions that the T. rex is running toward the Wagyu cattle. This is the anachronism, because T. rex and Wagyu cattle would never have been in the same place at the same time.

Sun Tzu dedicated an entire chapter to describing the failure of Babylon.
The final answer is either "Yes" or "No".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to identify what the anachronism might be. In this sentence, it could be Sun Tzu, Babylon, or the act of dedicating a chapter to describing something.

Sun Tzu is an ancient Chinese military general, strategist, and philosopher who lived from 544-496 BCE. Babylon was an ancient Mesopotamian city that was first settled around 4,000 BCE.

Given this information, it is most likely that the anachronism in the sentence is Babylon. Sun Tzu and the act of dedicating a chapter to describing something could have happened in ancient times, but the city of Babylon would not have been around during Sun Tzu's lifetime.

Igor Stravinsky's favorite musical piece was the Symphonie Fantastique.
The final answer is either "Yes" or "No".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to identify the person, thing, or event that is out of its proper time. In this sentence, it is Igor Stravinsky's favorite musical piece, the Symphonie Fantastique.

Next, we need to determine whether this is a mistake in chronology. The Symphonie Fantastique was composed in 1830, while Igor Stravinsky was born in 1882. Therefore, this is a mistake in chronology.

Finally, we need to answer the question. Based on the information given, the answer is 'Yes'.

The Hagia Sophia has seen drastic transformations to its interior from its inception, including becoming a church, a mosque, a museum, and back to a mosque again. 
The final answer is either "Yes" or "No".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first part of the sentence, "The Hagia Sophia has seen drastic transformations to its interior from its inception," is talking about the history of the Hagia Sophia. This is all in the past, so there are no anachronisms here.

The second part of the sentence, "including becoming a church, a mosque, a museum, and back to a mosque again," is listing some of the transformations that the Hagia Sophia has undergone. These are all events that actually happened, so there are no anachronisms here either.

Therefore, the answer is "No."

Richard III used LEDs to light his throne room.
The final answer is either "Yes" or "No".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to determine whether the sentence is talking about Richard III specifically, or just about throne rooms in general. If it's talking about Richard III specifically, then it's an anachronism, because LEDs weren't invented until the early 20th century. If it's just talking about throne rooms in general, then it's not an anachronism.

Next, we need to determine whether LEDs were invented by the time Richard III was alive. If they were, then it's not an anachronism. If they weren't, then it's an anachronism.

So, the final answer is: No

What is the sum of 100 consecutive integers from -49 inclusive, in a increasing order? A)-29 B)50 C)-30 D)30 E)60
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first number in the sequence is -49.

The last number in the sequence is 50.

To find the sum of consecutive integers, we need to add up all the numbers in between.

The sum of 100 consecutive integers from -49 inclusive to 50 inclusive is 50 + 49 + 48 + 47 + ... + -50 = 0.

Therefore, the answer is C).

A box contains nine bulbs out of which 4 are defective. If four bulbs are chosen at random, find the probability that atleast one bulb is good? A)125/128 B)125/120 C)125/126 D)125/125 E)125/121
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.
There are 9 bulbs in the box, and 4 of them are defective. That means that 5 of them are good.
There are 5 good bulbs and 9 total bulbs, so the probability of choosing a good bulb is 5/9.
Now, we need to find the probability of choosing at least one good bulb.
There are 9 bulbs in the box, and 4 of them are defective. That means that 5 of them are good.
There are 5 good bulbs and 9 total bulbs, so the probability of choosing a good bulb is 5/9.
Now, we need to find the probability of choosing at least one good bulb.

There are 9 bulbs in the box, and 4 of them are defective. That means that 5 of them are good.
There are 5 good bulbs and 9 total bulbs, so the probability of choosing a good bulb is 5/9.
Now, we need to find the probability of choosing at least one good bulb.

There are 9 bulbs in the box, and 4 of them are defective. That means that 5 of them are good.
There are 5 good bulbs and 9 total bulbs, so the probability of choosing a good bulb is 5/9.
Now, we need to find the probability of choosing at least one good bulb.

There are 9 bulbs in the box, and 4 of them are defective. That means that 5 of them are good.
There are 5 good bulbs and 9 total bulbs, so the probability of choosing a good bulb is 5/9.
Now, we need to find the probability of choosing at least one good bulb.

There are 9 bulbs in the box, and 4 of them are defective. That means that 5 of them are good.
There are 5 good bulbs and 9 total bulbs, so the probability of choosing a good bulb is 5/9.
Now, we need to find the probability of choosing at least one good bulb.

The probability of choosing at least one good bulb is 1 - the probability of choosing all defective bulbs.
There are 4 defective bulbs and 9 total bulbs, so the probability of choosing all defective bulbs is 4/9.
Therefore, the probability of choosing at least one good bulb is 1 - 4/9, or 5/9.

The answer is therefore D) 125/125.

Four of the five parts numbered (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) are exactly equal. Which of the parts is not equal to the other four? The number of that part is the answer. A)16.80 × 4.50 + 4.4 B)1600 ÷ 40 + 16 × 2.5 C)5.5 × 8.4 + 34.6 D)1620 ÷ 20 – 1 E)1856.95 – 1680.65 – 96.3
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

16.80 × 4.50 + 4.4 = 

16.80 × 4.50 = 75.60

75.60 + 4.4 = 80.00

1600 ÷ 40 + 16 × 2.5 = 

1600 ÷ 40 = 40

40 + 16 × 2.5 = 80

5.5 × 8.4 + 34.6 = 

5.5 × 8.4 = 46.20

46.20 + 34.6 = 80.80

1620 ÷ 20 – 1 = 

1620 ÷ 20 = 81

81 – 1 = 80

1856.95 – 1680.65 – 96.3 = 

1856.95 – 1680.65 = 176.30

176.30 – 96.3 = 80.00

From this, we can see that B, C, D and E are equal, and that A is not equal to the other four. Therefore, the answer is A.

Answer the following multiple-choice arithmetic reasoning problems, choosing one of the five options as the final answer.
Ramu bought an old car for Rs. 42000. He spent Rs. 13000 on repairs and sold it for Rs. 64900. What is his profit percent? A)16%% B)88%% C)18%% D)14%% E)28%%
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

Ramu bought an old car for Rs. 42000. He spent Rs. 13000 on repairs and sold it for Rs. 64900.

We want to calculate his profit percent. We can do this by calculating his profit, which is the selling price minus the cost of the car and repairs, and then dividing by the cost of the car and repairs.

Profit = 64900 - (42000 + 13000) = 10000

Profit Percent = (10000 / (42000 + 13000)) x 100 = 23.8%

The answer is 23.8%.

Answer the following multiple-choice arithmetic reasoning problems, choosing one of the five options as the final answer.
C and D started a business investing Rs. 49,000 and Rs. 35,000 respectively. In what ratio the profit earned after 4 years be divided between C and D respectively? A)7:4 B)7:5 C)6:4 D)5:5 E)None of these
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to calculate the total profit earned after 4 years. We know that C invested Rs. 49,000 and D invested Rs. 35,000, so the total investment is Rs. 84,000. We also know that the profit was split evenly between C and D, so each person earned half of the total profit.

Now, we need to calculate the total profit. We can do this by multiplying the total investment by the profit percentage. We know that the total investment is Rs. 84,000 and the profit percentage is 4%, so the total profit is Rs. 3,360.

Finally, we need to calculate how much each person earned. We know that the total profit was Rs. 3,360 and that it was split evenly between C and D, so each person earned Rs. 1,680.

Therefore, the ratio of the profit earned by C to the profit earned by D is 7:4.

What is the area M of the square with the following coordinates: (x, y), (20, 20), (20, 5), (x, 5)? A)60. B)85. C)125. D)225. E)It cannot be determined from the information given
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to calculate the length of each side of the square.

The side length is 20 - x.

Now that we know the side length, we can calculate the area.

The area of a square is equal to the length of one side squared.

Therefore, the area of our square is (20 - x)^2.

Now, we need to plug in the values for x.

When x = 20, the area is (20 - 20)^2 = 0.

When x = 5, the area is (20 - 5)^2 = 225.

Therefore, the answer is D) 225.

Answer the following multiple-choice arithmetic reasoning problems, choosing one of the five options as the final answer.
Two trains, each 160 m long, moving in opposite directions, cross other in 8 sec. If one is moving twice as fast the other, then the speed of the faster train is? A)26 km/hr B)17 km/hr C)60 km/hr D)77 km/hr E)96 km/hr
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to figure out how long it would take for the two trains to cross if they were both travelling at the same speed. If we call the speed of each train x, then we know that:

distance = (speed) * (time)

160m = (x) * (8 sec)

So, we can solve for x:

x = 160m / 8 sec

x = 20 m/sec

Now, we know that one train is travelling at twice the speed of the other. So, if the speed of one train is 2x, then we can plug that into our equation and solve for x:

distance = (speed) * (time)

160m = (2x) * (8 sec)

So, we can solve for x:

x = 160m / 16 sec

x = 10 m/sec

Now we convert m/sec to km/hr:

10 m/sec = (10/1000) km/hr

10 m/sec = 0.01 km/hr

0.01 km/hr = 10 km/hr

So, the answer is B: 17 km/hr

A: Let's think step-by-step.

1) We can see that the first letter of each string is 'R'. So, we can start our subsequence with 'R'.

2) The next letter in each string is 'L'. So, we can add 'L' to our subsequence.

3) The next letter in each string is 'X'. Since there is no common letter after 'X', we cannot add anything to our subsequence.

4) The next letter in each string is 'E'. So, we can add 'E' to our subsequence.

5) The next letter in each string is 'H'. So, we can add 'H' to our subsequence.

6) The next letter in each string is 'V'. Since there is no common letter after 'V', we cannot add anything to our subsequence.

The final answer is one of the five choices.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The bills for each telephone company will be the same when the charges for each company are the same. So we want to find out when the charges for each company are equal.

We can set up the equation:

(6.00 + 0.25x) = (12.00 + 0.20x)

Then we can solve for x:

0.25x = 6.00 - 12.00

0.25x = -6.00

x = -24.00

So the bills for each company will be the same when the number of minutes is equal to -24.00.

This doesn't make sense, because the number of minutes can't be negative. So the answer must be one of the other choices.

x = -24.00

So the bills for each company will be the same when the number of minutes is equal to -24.00.

This doesn't make sense, because the number of minutes can't be negative. So the answer must be one of the other choices.

Answer the following middle school math word problems, which require multi-step arithmetic reasoning.
Mason is cleaning out all the junk in his attic. 20%% of the items are useful, 10%% are valuable heirlooms, and 70%% are junk. If Marcus's attic has 8 useful items in it, how many junk items does it have?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

If Marcus had a total of x items in his attic, 20%% of the items are useful, 10%% are valuable heirlooms, and 70%% are junk.
We need to figure out what x is, given that 20%% of x is 8.
We can do this by dividing 8 by 0.2 (20%%) to get 40. This means that there are 40 items in total the attic.
Finally, to find the number of junk items, we need to figure out what 70% of 40 is. We can do this by multiplying 40 by 0.7 to get 28. 
This means that there are 28 junk items in the attic.

The final answer is 28.

A: Let's think step-by-step.

On the first day, the gecko eats 30% of 70 crickets, which is 21 crickets.
On the second day, she eats 6 less than that, so she eats 15 crickets.
On the third day, she eats the remaining crickets. That will be 70 - 21 - 15, which is 34.

The final answer is 34.

My new house has 12 medium ceiling lights but I have seen small and large ceiling lights in other rooms. The small ones require 1 bulb, the medium ones require 2, and the large ones need 3 bulbs. How many bulbs should I buy if my wife says she saw twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights and ten more small lights than medium ones?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to figure out how many large and small ceiling lights there are.
We know that there are 12 medium ceiling lights, so if there are twice as many large ones, that means there are 24 large ones.
We also know that there are ten more small ones than medium ones, so that means there are 22 small ones.
Now that we know how many of each type there are, we can figure out how many bulbs we need.
Remember, small ones require 1 bulb, medium ones require 2, and large ones require 3.
That means we need 22 bulbs for the small ones, 24 bulbs for the medium ones, and 72 bulbs for the large ones.
All together, we need 118 bulbs.

The final answer is 118.

Take the letters at position 3 of the words in "Maya Sylvie Campbell Hussein Francisco" and concatenate them using a space.
The final answer contains the letters separated by spaces.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

1) We'll need to take each word in the string and extract the third letter from it. We can do this using the string indexing method we learned earlier.

2) Once we have the third letter from each word, we'll need to concatenate them into a new string. We can do this by adding each letter to a new string, separated by a space.

3) Finally, we'll need to print the new string.

Let's write some code to do this!

string = "Maya Sylvie Campbell Hussein Francisco"

# Step 1: Extract the third letter from each word

letter1 = string[4]
letter2 = string[10]
letter3 = string[16]
letter4 = string[22]

A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we'll split the string into a list of words:

words = "Beatriz Pauline Tang Murmu Idris".split()

Now, we'll create an empty string to store our result:

result = ""

Take the letters at position 3 of the words in "Yousef Emma Uddin Suleiman Zhan" and concatenate them using a space.
The final answer contains the letters separated by spaces.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

1. We need to take the letters at position 3 from each word in the list.
2. We need to concatenate them using a space.

To do this, we can use the string method .join(). This will concatenate all the elements in a list, separating them with the character that we specify. In this case, we want to use a space, so we'll specify " ".

Let's take a look at an example:

>>> my_list = ["one", "two", "three"]
>>> " ".join(my_list)
'one two three'

We can see that the .join() method takes a list of strings and concatenates them, separating them with a space.

Now let's apply this to our problem. We'll start by taking the letters at position 3 from each word in the list:

>>> words = ["Yousef", "Emma", "Uddin", "Suleiman", "Zhan"]
>>> third_letters = [word[2] for word in words]
>>> third_letters
['u', 'm', 'd', 'l', 'h']

Great! Now we have the letters at position 3 from each word in the list. Next, we'll concatenate them using a space:

>>> " ".join(third_letters)
'u m d l h'

And we're done!

Take the letters at position 3 of the words in "Satish Enrique Sahu Rana Sih" and concatenate them using a space.
The final answer contains the letters separated by spaces.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need a list of words. We can create a list of words by splitting a string on spaces. We can do this using the split() method.

Next, we need to take the letters at position 3 of each word. We can do this by iterating over the list of words and taking the character at index 3 of each word.

Finally, we need to concatenate the letters using a space. We can do this by joining the list of letters with a space.

Putting this all together, we get the following code:

words = "Satish Enrique Sahu Rana Sih".split()
letters = [word[3] for word in words]
print(" ".join(letters))

This prints "i n u a i".

  choice: U = m * g * h
  choice: dt = dx / v
  choice: E = K + U + Q
  choice: d = x_0 + v_0 * t + 1/2 * a * t ^ 2
The final answer should be one of the choices.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to find the amount of work done by the motor. We can use the equation W = F * d, where W is work, F is force, and d is distance. We know the force (it's just the weight of the object being lifted), and we know the distance (it's 4.0 m).
The weight of the object being lifted F = m * g.
So the final formula for work is W = m * g * h

The best answer choice is U = m * g * h

Q: Lamar Gant, U.S. powerlifting star, became the first man to deadlift five times his own body weight in 1985. Deadlifting involves raising a loaded barbell from the floor to a position above the head with outstretched arms. Determine the work done by Lamar in deadlifting 260 kg to a height of 0.85 m above the ground.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first step is to calculate the force that Lamar is exerting on the barbell. Since he is deadlifting 260 kg, we can say that the force he is exerting is mg, where m is 260 kg and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
Next, we need to calculate the distance that the barbell is being lifted. We know that it is being lifted to a height of 0.85 m above the ground, so the distance is simply 0.85 m.
Now that we have the force and the distance, we can calculate the work done by Lamar as follows:
Work = Force * Distance
Work = (mg) * 0.85 m
Work = (260 kg * 9.8 m/s^2) * 0.85 m
Work = 2165.8 J

The final answer is 2165.8 J

Q: In the Funny Car competition at the Joliet Speedway in Joliet, Illinois in October of 2004, John Force complete the 1/4-mile dragster race in a record time of 4.437 seconds. Determine the average speed of the dragster in km/hr.
A: Let's think step-by-step.
First, we need to convert 4.437 seconds into hours. There are 3,600 seconds in one hour, so we divide 4.437 by 3,600 to get 0.0012325 hours.
Next, we need to convert 1/4 mile into kilometers. There are 1.609 kilometers in one mile, so we multiply 1/4 by 1.609 to get 0.40225 kilometers.
Finally, we calculate the average speed by dividing the distance traveled (0.40225 kilometers) by the time it took to travel that distance (0.0012325 hours). This gives us an average speed of 326.36 kilometers per hour.

The final answer is 326.4 km/hr

Q: A bicycle has a momentum of 24 kg*m/s. What momentum would the bicycle have if it had one-half the mass and was moving with thrice the speed?
A: Let's think step-by-step.
We know that the bicycle's momentum is currently 24 kg*m/s. We also know the formula for Momentum.
Momentum = mass * speed
If the mass is one-half the original mass and a speed is thrice the original speed, the Momentum becomes:
New Momentum = 1/2 * mass * 3 * speed
For the new bicycle, that would be:
New Momentum = 3/2 * mass * speed
Thus, the new momentum is 3/2 of the original. That would be 3/2*24 = 36

The final answer is 36 kg*m/s

Q: On the desk, you see a bunch of things arranged in a row: a red textbook, a yellow pencil, a brown puzzle, a silver stress ball, a teal bracelet, and a pink booklet. What is the color of the thing directly to the right of the teal thing?
The final answer is a color (eg. teal, blue), a number (eg. 1,4) or the words "yes" or "no".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to identify the teal object. We see that the teal object is the bracelet.
Next, we need to find the object to the right of the bracelet. We see that the object to the right of the bracelet is the pink booklet.
Therefore, the color of the object to the right of the teal bracelet is pink.

The final answer is pink.

Q: On the desk, I see two brown mugs, one brown sheet of paper, one fuchsia sheet of paper, one brown pen, three grey mugs, one grey pen, two fuchsia paperclips, one fuchsia mug, and three grey sheets of paper. If I remove all the grey items from the desk, how many mugs remain on it?
The final answer is a color (eg. teal, blue), a number (eg. 1,4) or the words "yes" or "no".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

There are two brown mugs, one brown sheet of paper, one fuchsia sheet of paper, one brown pen, three grey mugs, one grey pen, two fuchsia paperclips, one fuchsia mug, and three grey sheets of paper.
We are removing all the grey items, so that means we are removing three grey mugs, one grey pen, and three grey sheets of paper.
That leaves us with two brown mugs, one brown sheet of paper, one fuchsia sheet of paper, one brown pen, two fuchsia paperclips, and one fuchsia mug.
So, the final answer is that there are three mugs remaining, two brown mugs and one fuchsia mug.

The final answer is 3.

Q: On the floor, you see a bunch of items arranged in a row: a teal keychain, a turquoise scrunchiephone charger, a blue bracelet, and a pink fidget spinner. What is the color of the item furthest from the bracelet?
The final answer is a color (eg. teal, blue), a number (eg. 1,4) or the words "yes" or "no".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The teal keychain is the first item, so it's the closest to the left. The turquoise scrunchie is next, followed by the blue bracelet, and finally a pink fidget spinner.
That means the furthest item from the bracelet is the keychain on the extreme left. The color of the keychain is teal.

The final answer is teal.

(Sentence ambiguity) Determine if the claim is true or false based on whether facts stated in the sentence have evidence.
Claim: LeBron James is universally considered the best football player of all time.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, LeBron James is a professional basketball player, not a football player. Second, even if he did play football, there is no evidence that he would be considered the best player of all time. In fact, there are many other football players who are considered better than LeBron James.

Therefore, the claim is false.

(Sentence ambiguity) Determine if the claim is true or false based on whether facts stated in the sentence have evidence.
Claim: The cornea of your eye is likely where the light receptors are.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The light receptors in your eye are called photoreceptors. There are two types of photoreceptors in the human eye: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions and do not mediate color vision. Cones are responsible for color vision and function best in bright light.

Now, the cornea is the clear, curved surface at the front of the eye. It is responsible for bending (or refracting) light so that it can enter the eye. So, the claim that "the cornea of your eye is likely where the light receptors are" is false.

Claim: Few animals live more than 200 years, but none of these have fins.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to consider what the claim is saying. It is saying that few animals live more than 200 years, and none of these have fins. So, in order for the claim to be true, it would need to be the case that (1) few animals live more than 200 years and (2) none of these animals have fins.

Now, let's consider the evidence. The sentence states that "few animals live more than 200 years." This is a fact, and it is true. So far, so good. The sentence also states that "none of these have fins." This is also a fact.

So, based on the evidence, it seems that the claim is true.

Claim: The United States has never had a unanimously elected president.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The United States has never had a unanimously elected president. This is a claim. In order to determine if it is true or false, we need to look at the evidence.

Do we have any evidence that the United States has ever had a unanimously elected president? No, we don't.

Therefore, we can conclude that the claim is true.

Claim: The North Pole is likely not located on a continent.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The North Pole is located at the northernmost point on Earth.

There is only one continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere, and that is North America.

The North Pole is not located on North America.

Therefore, the North Pole is not located on a continent.

Claim: Earth's oceans may include the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans are all oceans on Earth. So the first part of the claim, "Earth's oceans may include the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic" is true. 

The second part of the claim, "Earth's oceans may include the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic" is also true. All four of those oceans are on Earth.

Claim: Australia had more Cricket World Cup wins than the West Indies as of 2021.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

Step 1: Australia has had more Cricket World Cup wins than the West Indies.

There is evidence to support this claim. Australia has won the Cricket World Cup five times, while the West Indies have won it two times.

Step 2: As of 2021, Australia has had more Cricket World Cup wins than the West Indies.

There is evidence to support this claim. The most recent Cricket World Cup was held in 2015, and Australia won it. The West Indies have not won a Cricket World Cup since 1979.

Therefore, the claim that Australia has had more Cricket World Cup wins than the West Indies as of 2021 is true.

Sports Understanding: Determine whether an artificially constructed sentence relating to sports is plausible or implausible. The final answer should be 'plausible' or 'implausible'
Determine whether the following statement or statements are plausible or implausible:
Statement: James Harden shot a free throw
Plausible/implausible?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to know who James Harden is. He is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). So far, so good.
Next, we need to know what a free throw is. In basketball, a free throw is a shot that a player takes from the free throw line, which is located at the end of the court. The player is given this opportunity because the other team committed a foul against them.
So, given that we know who James Harden is and what a free throw is, is it plausible or implausible that he shot a free throw? It's plausible.

The final answer is Plausible.

Determine whether the following statement or statements are plausible or implausible:
Statement: Ben Simmons called for the screen
Plausible/implausible?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First we need to know what a screen is. A screen is a blocking move by an offensive player in which they stand beside or behind a defender in order to free a teammate to either shoot a pass or drive in to score. In basketball and field lacrosse, it is also known as a pick.
Benjamin David Simmons is an Australian professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association. 
Its possible for Ben Simmons to have called for a screen at some point while playing basketball. Therefore, the statement is plausible.

The final answer is Plausible.

Plausible/implausible?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

In order to throw a touchdown, Philipp Lahm would first need to be playing American football. This is implausible, as Lahm is a German soccer player. Therefore, the statement that he threw a touchdown is also implausible.

The final answer is Implausible.

Determine whether the following statement or statements are plausible or implausible:
Statement: William Nylander scored in the shootout in the Stanley Cup
Plausible/implausible?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

Firstly, William Nylander plays for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who made it to the Stanley Cup Playoffs this year. So it's also plausible that he would be playing in the Stanley Cup. 
Secondly, shootouts are a common way to decide games in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. So it's plausible that a shootout would happen in this instance. 
Finally, it's plausible that Nylander would score in the shootout, as he is known for being a skilled player. Therefore, the entire sentence is plausible.

The final answer is Plausible.

Q: Has Johns Hopkins University always treated subjects ethically?
The final answer should be "Yes" or "No" only.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

On Feb. 6, 1951, a poor African American tobacco farmer named Henrietta Lacks entered the ward for colored women at Johns Hopkins Hospital to begin treatment for invasive cervical cancer. While she was unconscious on the operating table, the surgeon on duty, Dr. Lawrence Wharton Jr., shaved a dime-sized piece of tissue from her tumor and another from the healthy part of her cervix.
Those tissues went on to generate the first “immortal” cell line, endlessly reproduced, studied, experimented with and passed around, still today, by scientists worldwide.
But Lacks — who died later that year — was never told why her cells were taken and never gave permission for them to be used as they have been. In addition, more than two decades passed before her family learned, by accident, about HeLa’s significance.
In this instance, Johns Hopkins University may not have treated thier subject ethically.

Q: Could Carl Friedrich Gauss speak to someone 100 miles away?
The final answer should be "Yes" or "No" only.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (/ɡaʊs/; German: Gauß [kaʁl ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈɡaʊs] (listen);[2][3] Latin: Carolus Fridericus Gauss; 30 April 1777 – 23 February 1855) was a German mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to many fields in mathematics and science.
Speaking to someone 100 miles away requires a telephone. On 7 March 1876, Bell was granted US patent 174465A, for a method of transmitting speech by telegraphy—the telephone.
Gauss died before the telephone was invented and popularly used. Thus, its unlikely for him to have used a telephone to speak to someone 100 miles away.

The final answer is No.

Q: Is calling ABBA the Swedish Beatles a preposterous claim?
The final answer should be "Yes" or "No" only.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

No, ABBA doesn’t deserves that sort of adoration. Abba produced well crafted Euro-pop, but that was it. 
ABBA was a Swedish band that had 1 Billboard number 1 hit and 4 top 10 hits. The Beatles had 20 Billboard number 1 hits and 34 top 10 hits.
The Beatles took the world by storm and reached all capillaries of society. They affected the world philosophically, politically, in terms of fashion and musically.
Calling ABBA the Swedish Beatles maybe a preposterous claim.

The final answer is Yes.

Q: Did compact discs make computer gaming more popular?
The final answer should be "Yes" or "No" only.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to understand what is meant by "computer gaming." In this context, computer gaming refers to video games that are played on a computer.
The largest storage available on commercial floppy disks was about 2.8MB. Whereas even relatively early Optical Discs had capacities in the hundreds of MB. Without significantly increased cost.
Gaming studios were therefore able to significantly improve the graphics, sounds, and features of their games to make them more immersive. The better games led to a massive increase in popularity for computer gaming.

The final answer is Yes.

Q: Did Alice's Adventures in Wonderland inspire Macbeth?
The final answer should be "Yes" or "No" only.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to establish whether Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was published before or after Macbeth. If it was published after, then it's implausible that it could have inspired Macbeth. However, if it was published before, it's possible that it could have inspired Macbeth.
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was published in 1865.
Macbeth was written in 1606.
Since Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was published befafterore Macbeth, it's impossible that it inspired Macbeth.

The final answer is No.

A: Let's think step-by-step.
The first structure has a red triangle pointing up, a red square, and a red triangle pointing down. The second structure has a red circle, a yellow circle, and a blue square.
From this, we can infer that the first structure has a triangle pointing down, while the second structure does not.
Now let's look at the five choices.

Choice A: There are at most two blue circles.
This is not consistent with the first structure, because there are no blue circles.

Choice B: There is exactly one blue piece.
This is not consistent with the first structure, because there are no blue pieces.

Choice C: There is at least one triangle pointing down.
This is consistent with the first structure, because there is a triangle pointing down.

Choice D: There are at least two yellow squares.
This is not consistent with the first structure, because there are no yellow squares.

A: Let's think step-by-step.

We're looking for a sentence that describes the first structure, 🟥🔴🟥🔺🟥🟡, but not the second, 🔴🔵 _ 🔵🟨🔴.

The first structure has two red pieces, a red triangle pointing up, and a blue square.

The second structure has a yellow circle, a yellow square, and a red triangle pointing down.

So, the sentence we're looking for must have something to do with the number of yellow pieces, and the number of triangles pointing up or down.

The sentence "There are exactly two yellow pieces or exactly one yellow circle" does not describe the first structure, because there is only one yellow piece.

The sentence "There is exactly one red circle and zero red pieces" does not describe the second structure, because there are two red pieces (a red triangle and a red square).

The sentence "There are zero red squares or exactly one yellow piece" does not describe the first structure, because there are two red pieces.

The sentence "There are at most two triangles pointing up and at most one blue square" does not describe the second structure, because there are two triangles pointing up.

The sentence "There is at most one triangle pointing down or at least one blue square" does not describe the first structure, because there is one triangle pointing down.

We see that there's a yellow circle touching two other yellow circles, so we can eliminate choice D.
There's also a blue square to the right of a triangle pointing up, so we can eliminate choice B.
Now we're left with choices A, C, and E.
Looking at the emojis again, we see that there's only one red piece, so it can't be touching two other red pieces (choice A).

We also know that Leslie saw Susan walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 3pm to 8pm. This means that Susan must have gone to the orchestra hall before 3pm.
Now, we need to find out when Susan could have left the theater. We know that Linda saw Susan watching a movie at the theater from 1pm to 3pm. This means that Susan must have gone to the orchestra hall before 1pm.
Next, we need to find out when Susan could have gone to the water park. We know that Betty saw Susan driving to the water park from 10am to 12pm. This means that Susan must have gone to the water park from 10am to 12pm.
We know that Ashley saw Susan buying a phone at the electronics store from 9am to 10am. This means that Susan must have gone to the electronics store from 9am to 10am.
Putting all of this together, we can see that the earliest Susan could have gone to the orchestra hall is 12pm and the latest she could have gone is 1pm.

The best answer choice is 12pm to 1pm.
