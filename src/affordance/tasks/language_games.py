A: Let's think step-by-step.
1. "Amisay" -> "Amisay" is the same in both languages.
2. "adhay" -> "adhay" is the same in both languages.
3. "efensiveday" -> "efensiveday" is the same in both languages.
4. "oundsway" -> "oundsway" is the same in both languages.
5. "onyay" -> "onyay" is the same in both languages.
6. "ishay" -> "ishay" is the same in both languages.
7. "armsyay" -> "armsyay" is the same in both languages.

The final answer is Amisay adhay efensiveday oundsway onyay ishay armsyay.
----
Language Games: Pig Latin looks just like English, but if an English word starts with a vowel you add -yay at the end of the word (ice -> iceyay); if it starts with consonants, you move them to end of the word and add -ay (prank -> ankpray); if it is capitalized, the Pig Latin word is capitalized as well (Maggie -> Aggiemay). Translate Pig Latin into English or viceversa.
(Pig Latin) Iyay ishway otay aystay inyay Australiayay.(English)
The final answer contains the translated sequence.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

Iyay -> I
I ishway -> I am
I am otay -> I am not
I am not aystay -> I am not staying
I am not staying inyay -> I am not staying in
I am not staying in Australiayay -> I am not staying in Australia.

The final answer is I am not staying in Australia.
