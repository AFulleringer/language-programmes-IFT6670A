The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

Ramu bought an old car for Rs. 42000.
He spent Rs. 13000 on repairs.
That means he paid Rs. 42000 + 13000 = 55000 for the car.
He sold it for Rs. 64900.
His profit was Rs. 64900 - Rs. 55000, or Rs. 9900.
His profit percent was Rs. 9900 / Rs. 55000, which is 18%.

C and D started a business investing Rs. 49,000 and Rs. 35,000 respectively. In what ratio the profit earned after 4 years be divided between C and D respectively? A)7:4 B)7:5 C)6:4 D)5:5 E)None of these
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first step is to calculate the total profit earned after 4 years. We know that the total investment is Rs. 49,000 + Rs. 35,000 = Rs. 84,000. With no loss of generality, lets assume profit earned is 10%.
10%% of Rs. 84,000 is Rs. 8,400.
This means that the total profit earned is Rs. 8,400.
The next step is to calculate the ratio of profit earned by C and D. We know that C invested Rs. 49,000 and D invested Rs. 35,000.
The ratio of profit earned by C and D is Rs. 8,400 : Rs. 8,400 = 49,000 : 35,000.
This means that the ratio of profit earned by C and D is 7:5.
The final answer is option B: 7:5.

The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to calculate the length of one side of the square. We can do this by finding the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the two points on that side. 
There are two consecutive coordinates that we know make a side: (20, 20), (20, 5).
In this case, the difference between the y-coordinates of the points (20, 20) and (20, 5) is 20 - 5 = 15.
Next, we need to find the area of the square. The area of a square is equal to the length of one side squared. In this case, that would be 15^2.
Therefore, the answer is D: 225.

The final answer is D.

The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

Shobha's Mathematics Test had 75 problems in total.
10 arithmetic problems + 30 algebra problems + 35 geometry problems = 75 problems
Shobha answered 70%% of the arithmetic problems correctly.
70%% of 10 arithmetic problems = 7 arithmetic problems
Shobha answered 40%% of the algebra problems correctly.
40%% of 30 algebra problems = 12 algebra problems
Shobha answered 60%% of the geometry problems correctly.
60%% of 35 geometry problems = 21 geometry problems
Shobha needed a 60% passing grade, which would be 45 problems.
7 arithmetic problems + 12 algebra problems + 21 geometry problems = 45 problems
Shobha answered a total of 40 problems correctly.
40 problems < 45 problems
Shobha would need to answer 5 more problems correctly to earn a 60% passing grade.

If a, b, and c are consecutive even integers and a < b < c, all of the following must be divisible by 4 EXCEPT A)a + c B)b + c C)ac D)(bc)/2 E)(abc)/4
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

a, b, and c are consecutive even integers and a < b < c. Thus b is a+2 and c is a+4. Since a it even, it is divisible by 2. Therefore, we can write a as 2x for some integer x.
Therefore a is 2x, b is 2x + 2, and c is 2x + 4
Let's consider each option.
a + c is 2x + 2x + 4 which is 2x + 4. 4x + 4 is divisible by 4. This eliminates option A.
b + c is 2x + 2 + 2x + 4 which is 4x + 6. 4x is divisible by 4 but 6 is not. Thus, this option is not divisible by 4. 
ac is 2x*(2x+4), which is 4x^2 + 8x. 4x^2 + 8x is divisible by 4. This eliminates option C.
bc/2 is (2x + 2)*(2x + 4)/2. This evaluates to 2x^2 + 6x + 4. For both even and odd values of x, this expression is divisible by 4. This eliminates option D.
(abc)/4 is 2x*(2x + 2)*(2x + 4)/4. This evaluates to 2x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x. divisible by 4. As before, for both even and odd values of x, this expression is divisible by 4. This eliminates option E.

The final answer is B.

Two trains, each 160 m long, moving in opposite directions, cross other in 8 sec. If one is moving twice as fast the other, then the speed of the faster train is? A)26 km/hr B)17 km/hr C)60 km/hr D)77 km/hr E)48 km/hr
The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

We're told that two trains cross each other in 8 seconds.
We're told that one train is moving twice as fast as the other train.
That means the speed of the slower train is 1/2 the speed of the faster train.
We're asked to find the speed of the faster train.
The speed of the faster train is twice the speed of the faster train. Therefore, it covers twice the distance as the slower train.
Since the trains are moving in opposite directions and pass each other, 160 meters is the distance covered by both trains in 8 seconds.
2/3 of this distance is covered by the faster train. Therefore the faster train covers 160*2/3m in 8 seconds. Thus, it covers 320/3m in 8s. Its speed is (320/3)/8, which is 40/3 m/s.
Converting to kilometers per hour, we get 40/3*(18/5). This is 48 km/hr, or option E.

The final answer is E.

To find the sum of consecutive integers, we need to add up all the numbers in between.

The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.
There are 9 bulbs in the box, and 4 of them are defective. That means that 5 of them are good.
There are 5 good bulbs and 9 total bulbs, so the probability of choosing a good bulb is 5/9.

The probability of choosing at least one good bulb is 1 - the probability of choosing all defective bulbs.

Ramu bought an old car for Rs. 42000. He spent Rs. 13000 on repairs and sold it for Rs. 64900.
We want to calculate his profit percent. We can do this by calculating his profit, which is the selling price minus the cost of the car and repairs, and then dividing by the cost of the car and repairs.
Profit = 64900 - (42000 + 13000) = 10000
Profit Percent = (10000 / (42000 + 13000)) x 100 = 23.8%

The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to calculate the total profit earned after 4 years. We know that C invested Rs. 49,000 and D invested Rs. 35,000, so the total investment is Rs. 84,000. We also know that the profit was split evenly between C and D, so each person earned half of the total profit.
Now, we need to calculate the total profit. We can do this by multiplying the total investment by the profit percentage. We know that the total investment is Rs. 84,000 and the profit percentage is 4%, so the total profit is Rs. 3,360.
Finally, we need to calculate how much each person earned. We know that the total profit was Rs. 3,360 and that it was split evenly between C and D, so each person earned Rs. 1,680.
Therefore, the ratio of the profit earned by C to the profit earned by D is 7:4.

The final answer one of the five options.
A: Let's think step-by-step.
First, we need to calculate the length of each side of the square.
The side length is 20 - x.
Now that we know the side length, we can calculate the area.
The area of a square is equal to the length of one side squared.
Therefore, the area of our square is (20 - x)^2.
Now, we need to plug in the values for x.
When x = 20, the area is (20 - 20)^2 = 0.
When x = 5, the area is (20 - 5)^2 = 225.

Description: Solve the following middle-school arithmetic problems, writing out intermediate arithmetic calculations as python code. Store your result as a variable named 'ans'.
Input: Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?
Q1: [generate python code] write down the arithmetic or algebra equations as python code
#1:
numb_of_chickens = 20

cups_for_all_chicken = num_of_chickens * cups_for_each_chicken
cups_in_the_morning = 15
cups_in_the_afternoon = 25
ans = cups_for_all_chicken - cups_in_the_morning - cups_in_the_afternoon

Description: Solve the following problems on financial data in the form of text and tables, writing out intermediate calculations as python code. Store your result as a variable named 'ans'.
Input: american tower corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements ( 3 ) consists of customer-related intangibles of approximately $75.0 million and network location intangibles of approximately $72.7 million. the customer-related intangibles and network location intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to 20 years. For acquired customer-related and network location intangibles, what is the expected annual amortization expenses, in millions?
Q1: [generate python code] write down the arithmetic or algebra equations as python code
#1:
