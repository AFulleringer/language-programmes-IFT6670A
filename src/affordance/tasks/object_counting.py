Q: I have a mouse, a goat, and two fish. How many animals do I have?
The final answer is the count of requested items in words, like "six" or "ten".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to identify what kind of item we're looking for. In this case, the question is asking for animals, so we're looking for anything that's classified as an animal.
We have a mouse, which is an animal, and a goat, which is also an animal. So far, we have two animals.
But wait! Fish are also animals. So we have two fish, which means we have a total of four animals.

The final answer is four.

A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to identify what kind of item we're looking for. In this case, the question is asking for fruits, so we're looking for anything that's classified as an fruit.
There is a strawberry, a grape, an apple, an orange, a plum, two nectarines, two bananas, and a peach. All these items are fuits. There are a total of ten fruits.

The list of items is:
violin
two nectarines
flute
banana
accordion
two strawberries
clarinet
drum
trumpet

The list of musical instruments is:
violin

The final answer is the count of requested items in words, like "six" or "ten".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to identify which items are musical instruments. We see that the trumpet, clarinet, piano, trombone, and violin are all musical instruments.
Next, we need to count how many musical instruments there are. We see that there are five musical instruments.
Finally, we need to write the answer in words. We see that there are five musical instruments, so we would say "five."

The final answer is five.

The final answer is the count of requested items in words, like "six" or "ten".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

There are three potatoes, so we can say "three" or "3".
There are two cauliflowers, so we can say "two" or "2".
Adding the potatoes and cauliflowers together, we get "five" or "5".
Now let's think about the broccoli.
There are three heads of broccoli, so we can say "three" or "3".
Adding the potatoes, cauliflowers, and broccoli together, we get "eight" or "8".
Now let's add the rest of the vegetables.
There is one cabbage, so we can say "one" or "1".
There is one stalk of celery, so we can say "one" or "1".
There is one carrot, so we can say "one" or "1".
There is one lettuce head, so we can say "one" or "1".

A: Let's think step-by-step.

There are three bananas, a trumpet, a clarinet, a piano, a nectarine, a trombone, a blackberry, and a violin.
We are looking for musical instruments, so we can ignore the bananas and the nectarine.

#4: 2 workers working for 10 hours making 4 toys per hour produce 2*10*4 = 80 toys.
Q5: [arithmetic] How many toys did the last worker make?
#5: Out of 400 toys, 120+80=200 toys were made by the first 4 workers. The 5th worker didn't finish the job, since 20 toys were still remaining to be made. So they made 400-200-20=180 toys.
Q6: [arithmetic] How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce if he worked for 10 hours?
#6: The 5th worker made 180/10 = 18 toys per hour.
Q7: [EOC]
