Claim: LeBron James is universally considered the best football player of all time.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first step is to break down the claim into smaller pieces. In this case, we have:
-LeBron James is universally considered the best football player of all time.
The next step is to look at each individual part of the claim and see if there is evidence to support it. In this case, we have:
-LeBron James is universally considered the best football player of all time.
There is no evidence to support this claim. LeBron James is not universally considered the best football player of all time. Therefore, the claim is false.

The final answer is False.

(Sentence ambiguity) Determine if the claim is true or false based on whether facts stated in the sentence have evidence.
Claim: The cornea of your eye is likely where the light receptors are.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, what are light receptors? They are cells that receive light and convert it into electrical signals.
Second, where are they located in the eye? They are located in the retina, which is at the back of the eye.
Third, what is the cornea? The cornea is the clear, outer layer of the eye.
Based on these facts, we can conclude that the claim is false. The light receptors are not located in the cornea.

The final answer is False.

Claim: Few animals live more than 200 years, but none of these have fins.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to determine what the claim is actually saying. In this case, the claim is saying that there are few animals that live more than 200 years, and none of those animals have fins.
Now, we need to think about whether or not this claim is true. In order to do that, we need to gather evidence.
First, let's look at the evidence for the first part of the claim, that there are few animals that live more than 200 years. According to this article, the oldest recorded age for various animals are as follows:
- humans: 122 years
- elephants: 86 years
- parrots: 82 years
- tortoises: 152 years
Based on this evidence, it appears that the claim is true - there are few animals that live more than 200 years.

Now, let's look at the evidence for the second part of the claim, that none of those animals have fins. According to this article, the oldest recorded age for various animals are as follows:
- humans: 122 years
- elephants: 86 years
- parrots: 82 years
- tortoises: 152 years
- salmon: 7 years
Based on this evidence, it appears that the claim is false - there is at least one animal that lives more than 200 years and has fins (salmon).

The final answer is False.

Claim: The North Pole is likely not located on a continent.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

There is no land at the North Pole - it is permanently covered in ice. So the North Pole is not located on a continent. Hence, the claim is true.

The final answer is True.
----
(Sentence ambiguity) Determine if the claim is true or false based on whether facts stated in the sentence have evidence.
Claim: Earth's oceans may include the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to determine what the claim is saying. The claim is saying that the oceans on Earth may include the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans.
Next, we need to see if there is evidence to support this claim. From looking at a map, we can see that there is indeed evidence to support this claim, as the oceans mentioned are all present on Earth.
Therefore, we can conclude that the claim is true.

The final answer is True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.

Australia has won the Cricket World Cup 5 times. The West Indies have won the Cricket World Cup 2 times. As of 2021, Australia has more Cricket World Cup wins than the West Indies. Therefore, the claim is true.

The final answer is True.

Claim: LeBron James is universally considered the best football player of all time.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to establish what "universally considered" means. This is a pretty strong claim, so we're going to need to see evidence that literally everyone believes LeBron James is the best football player of all time.
Next, we need to consider the evidence. Even if everyone believes LeBron James is the best football player of all time, is there any actual evidence to support this claim?
Based on these two considerations, it seems fair to say that the claim is false.

The final answer is false.

Claim: The cornea of your eye is likely where the light receptors are.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The cornea of your eye is the outermost layer of your eye. The light receptors are located in the retina, which is the innermost layer of your eye. So, the claim that the cornea of your eye is likely where the light receptors are is false.

The final answer is false.

Claim: Few animals live more than 200 years, but none of these have fins.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.
First, we'll look at the claim that "few animals live more than 200 years." To determine if this is true, we'll need to find evidence of how long different animals live.
According to this website, the longest-living land animal is the bowhead whale, which can live up to 211 years. The longest-living vertebrate in the sea is the greenland shark, which can live up to 400 years.
Based on this information, we can say that the claim that "few animals live more than 200 years" is false - there are at least two animals that have been documented to live over 200 years.

Now, we'll look at the claim that "none of these have fins." We'll need to find evidence of whether or not the bowhead whale and the greenland shark have fins.
According to this website, the bowhead whale does have fins. This website says that the greenland shark does not have fins.
Based on this information, we can say that the claim that "none of these have fins" is also false - at least one of the animals that can live over 200 years (the bowhead whale) does have fins.
In conclusion, both claims in the sentence are false.

The final answer is false.

(Sentence ambiguity) Determine if the claim is true or false based on whether facts stated in the sentence have evidence.
Claim: The United States has never had a unanimously elected president.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, what does it mean for a president to be "unanimously elected"? This means that every single person who voted, voted for that one president.
Now, has the United States ever had a president who was elected with every single vote?
The answer is no. The United States has never had a unanimously elected president.

The final answer is true.

(Sentence ambiguity) Determine if the claim is true or false based on whether facts stated in the sentence have evidence.
Claim: The North Pole is likely not located on a continent.
True or False?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

There are seven continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South America, Australia, and Antarctica. The North Pole is located in the Arctic Ocean, which is adjacent to Europe, Asia, and North America. So, the North Pole is not on a continent.

The final answer is true.

A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first part of the claim is that Earth has oceans. This is a fact that is widely accepted and supported by evidence.
The second part of the claim is that the oceans may include the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic. This is also a fact that is widely accepted and supported by evidence.
Therefore, the entire claim is true.

The final answer is true.

A: Let's think step-by-step.

Australia has won the Cricket World Cup 5 times as of 2021. The West Indies have won the Cricket World Cup 2 times as of 2021. 5 is greater than 2, so the claim is true.
