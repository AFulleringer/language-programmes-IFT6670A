How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is 2.

Next, we need to find the age of Gwen. We can see that Gwen is the fourth penguin listed in the table, and her age is 8.
Now, we need to find a penguin who is older than Bernard and younger than Gwen. We can see that Louis is the first penguin listed in the table, and his age is 7. Therefore, Louis is the penguin we are looking for.
