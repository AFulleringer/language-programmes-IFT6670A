 Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
The final answer is either "valid" or "invalid".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first premise is: "Whatever is not both an ingredient of Eye brow pencil and an ingredient of Minnie shampoo is an ingredient of All Good Things 12g or an ingredient of Restore.next." This is a perfectly fine premise.
The second premise is: "Every ingredient of All Good Things 12g is not an ingredient of Eye brow pencil or not an ingredient of Minnie shampoo." This is also a perfectly fine premise.
From these two premises, the conclusion that "Whatever is an ingredient of Eye brow pencil and an ingredient of Minnie shampoo is also an ingredient of Restore" does indeed logically follow. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Q:"Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First of all, being a granddaughter of Connie is necessary for being a niece of Marisa. Next, some granddaughter of Connie is not a close friend of Erika. All this entails that some close friend of Erika is not a niece of Marisa."
 Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
The final answer is either "valid" or "invalid".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first premise states that being a granddaughter of Connie is necessary for being a niece of Marisa. In other words, all nieces of Marisa are granddaughters of Connie.
The second premise states that some granddaughter of Connie is not a close friend of Erika. This means that there is at least one granddaughter of Connie who is not a close friend of Erika.
From these two premises, we can deduce that some close friend of Erika is not a niece of Marisa. This is because if being a granddaughter of Connie is necessary for being a niece of Marisa, and there is at least one granddaughter of Connie who is not a close friend of Erika, then it follows that there is at least one close friend of Erika who is not a niece of Marisa. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Q:"Some football fans admire various clubs, others love only a single team. But who is a fan of whom precisely? The following argument pertains to this question: First of all, every opponent to FC Admira Wacker Mödling is a backer of Rosenborg BK and an admirer of HNK Rijeka. Next, Elias is not a backer of Rosenborg BK or not an admirer of HNK Rijeka. We may conclude: Elias is not an opponent to FC Admira Wacker Mödling."
 Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
The final answer is either "valid" or "invalid".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first premise is "Every opponent to FC Admira Wacker Mödling is a backer of Rosenborg BK and an admirer of HNK Rijeka." This is a categorical syllogism in which the minor premise is the universal affirmative "Every opponent to FC Admira Wacker Mödling is a backer of Rosenborg BK" and the conclusion is the particular affirmative "Elias is a backer of Rosenborg BK." The syllogism is valid, but the first premise is false. The second premise is "Elias is not a backer of Rosenborg BK or not an admirer of HNK Rijeka." This is a disjunctive syllogism in which the first disjunct is the particular negative "Elias is not a backer of Rosenborg BK" and the second disjunct is the particular negative "Elias is not an admirer of HNK Rijeka." The conclusion is the particular negative "Elias is not an opponent to FC Admira Wacker Mödling." The syllogism is valid, but the first premise is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid.

Q:"Is Siri a stepsister of Mary? Is Susan related to Kate? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, Bonnie is a schoolmate of Miranda. Moreover, whoever is a workmate of Aubrey is not a schoolmate of Miranda. All this entails that Bonnie is not a workmate of Aubrey."
 Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?

The final answer is either "valid" or "invalid".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first premise is "Bonnie is a schoolmate of Miranda." This is true.
The second premise is "Whoever is a workmate of Aubrey is not a schoolmate of Miranda." This is also true.
The conclusion is "Bonnie is not a workmate of Aubrey." This follows logically from the premises, so the argument is valid.

Q:"Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First premise: Being a rare consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is sufficient for being a regular user of Dermasil soap. Second premise: Whoever is regular consumer of Crafted soap is at least one of these: an owner of a TIGI shampoo, a rare consumer of Tom's of Maine soap or a regular user of Redken shampoo. Third premise: Whoever is an owner of a TIGI shampoo is not a regular user of Dermasil soap. Hence, whoever is a regular consumer of Crafted soap is not a regular user of Dermasil soap or a regular user of Redken shampoo."
 Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
The final answer is either "valid" or "invalid".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first premise is "Being a rare consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is sufficient for being a regular user of Dermasil soap." This is not a valid premise, because it is possible to be a rare consumer of Tom's of Maine soap and not be a regular user of Dermasil soap.
The second premise is "Whoever is regular consumer of Crafted soap is at least one of these: an owner of a TIGI shampoo, a rare consumer of Tom's of Maine soap or a regular user of Redken shampoo." This is a valid premise.
The third premise is "Whoever is an owner of a TIGI shampoo is not a regular user of Dermasil soap." This is not a valid premise, because it is possible to be an owner of a TIGI shampoo and also be a regular user of Dermasil soap. 
Therefore, the argument is invalid.
