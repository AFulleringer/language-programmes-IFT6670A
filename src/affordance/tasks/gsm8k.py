Mason is cleaning out all the junk in his attic. 20%% of the items are useful, 10%% are valuable heirlooms, and 70%% are junk. If Marcus's attic has 8 useful items in it, how many junk items does it have?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

If Marcus had a total of x items in his attic, 20%% of the items are useful, 10%% are valuable heirlooms, and 70%% are junk.
We need to figure out what x is, given that 20%% of x is 8.
We can do this by dividing 8 by 0.2 (20%%) to get 40. This means that there are 40 items in total the attic.
Finally, to find the number of junk items, we need to figure out what 70% of 40 is. We can do this by multiplying 40 by 0.7 to get 28. 
This means that there are 28 junk items in the attic.

The final answer is 28.

A gecko eats 70 crickets every three days.  The first day she eats 30%% of the crickets.  The second day she eats 6 less than the first, and the third day she finishes up the remaining crickets.  How many crickets does she eat on the third day?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

On the first day, the gecko eats 30% of 70 crickets, which is 21 crickets.
On the second day, she eats 6 less than that, so she eats 15 crickets.
On the third day, she eats the remaining crickets. That will be 70 - 21 - 15, which is 34.

The final answer is 34.

Answer the following middle school math word problems, which require multi-step arithmetic reasoning.
My new house has 12 medium ceiling lights but I have seen small and large ceiling lights in other rooms. The small ones require 1 bulb, the medium ones require 2, and the large ones need 3 bulbs. How many bulbs should I buy if my wife says she saw twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights and ten more small lights than medium ones?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to figure out how many large and small ceiling lights there are.
We know that there are 12 medium ceiling lights, so if there are twice as many large ones, that means there are 24 large ones.
We also know that there are ten more small ones than medium ones, so that means there are 22 small ones.
Now that we know how many of each type there are, we can figure out how many bulbs we need.
Remember, small ones require 1 bulb, medium ones require 2, and large ones require 3.
That means we need 22 bulbs for the small ones, 24 bulbs for the medium ones, and 72 bulbs for the large ones.
All together, we need 118 bulbs.

The final answer is 118.

Tim buys a cabinet for $1200 and gets a 15%% discount.  How much did he pay?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

To calculate the discount Tim gets, we find 15%% of 1200. This is 180. Subtracting the discount amount from 1200 gets us 1020. Thus, Tim paid 1020.

The final answer is 1020

A: Let's think step-by-step.

Hunter scored a 45 on his math test. John received twice as many points as Hunter. Thus John got 90. Grant scored 10 points higher on his math test than John. So Grant got a 100 on the test.

How many bulbs should I buy if my wife says she saw twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights and ten more small lights than medium ones?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

There are 12 medium ceiling lights, so that's 24 bulbs right there.
There are twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights. That's 24 more bulbs, for a total of 48.
There are ten more small ceiling lights than medium ceiling lights. That's 20 more bulbs, for a total of 68.
So, you should buy 68 light bulbs.

Tim buys a cabinet for $1200 and gets a 15%% discount.  How much did he pay?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to calculate the 15% discount, which would be $1200 * 0.15 = $180.
Then, we subtract the discount from the original price of the cabinet, so $1200 - $180 = $1020.
This means that Tim paid $1020 for the cabinet.

The final answer is $1020.

Answer the following middle school math word problems, which require multi-step arithmetic reasoning.
Grant scored 10 points higher on his math test than John.  John received twice as many points as Hunter who scored a 45 on his math test.  What was Grant's test score?
A: Let's think step-by-step.

Grant scored 10 points higher than John. So, if we know John's score, we can find Grant's. John received twice as many points as Hunter, who scored a 45. So, we can set up the following equation:
2(Hunter's score) = John's score
Solving for Hunter's score, we get:
2(45) = John's score
John's score = 90
Now we can plug John's score into our original equation:
Grant's score = 10 + John's score
Grant's score = 10 + 90
Grant's score = 100

The final answer is 100.
