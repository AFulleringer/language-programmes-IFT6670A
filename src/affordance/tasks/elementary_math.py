The final answer is one of the five choices.
A: Let's think step-by-step.
 
First, we need to calculate how much money was made from sales of $4 frisbees. This is easy - we simply multiply the number of $4 frisbees sold by 4. So, if x is the number of $4 frisbees sold, we have:
64 frisbees were sold for 196$ in total, some for $3 and the rest for $4 each.
Let's assume x frisbees were sold for $4 and y frisbees were sold for $3.
Then x + y is 64 and 4*x + 3*y is 196. Solving for x gives us 4.
So, the fewest number of $4 frisbees that could have been sold is 4.

The final answer is 4.

20 mL divided by 1,000 mL is equal to 0.02. Therefore, the answer is .02.

 choice:160 minutes
The final answer is one of the five choices.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

We want to know how many minutes it would take for the bills for each telephone company to be the same.
We know that united telephone charges a base rate of $6.00 for service, plus an additional charge of $0.25 per minute.
We also know that atlantic call charges a base rate of $12.00 for service, plus an additional charge of $0.20 per minute.
In order to find out how many minutes it would take for the bills to be the same, we need to compare the two rates.
We can do this by subtracting the atlantic call's base rate from the united telephone's base rate, and then dividing that result by the difference in the per-minute charges.
This gives us the following equation:
divide(subtract(12.00, 6.00), subtract(0.25, 0.20))
Solving this equation, we find that it would take 120 minutes for the bills to be the same.

The final answer choice is 120 minutes.

The final answer is one of the five choices.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

There were a total of 64 frisbees sold.
Some were sold for $3, and the rest were sold for $4.
This means that the total number of frisbees sold for $4 must be equal to or greater than the total number of frisbees sold for $3.

We can set up the following equation:
3x + 4y = 196
y must be at least 8 in order for the equation to be true.
This means that the fewest number of $4 frisbees that could have been sold is 8.

The best answer choice is 8.

The final answer is one of the five choices.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The bills for each telephone company will be the same when the charges for each company are the same. So we want to find out when the charges for each company are equal.
We can set up the equation:
(6.00 + 0.25x) = (12.00 + 0.20x)
Then we can solve for x:
0.25x = 6.00 - 12.00
0.25x = -6.00
x = -24.00
So the bills for each company will be the same when the number of minutes is equal to -24.00.
This doesn't make sense, because the number of minutes can't be negative. So the answer must be one of the other choices.

B: Let's think step-by-step.

Then we can solve for x:
0.25x = 6.00 - 12.00
0.25x = -6.00
x = -24.00
So the bills for each company will be the same when the number of minutes is equal to -24.00.
This doesn't make sense, because the number of minutes can't be negative. So the answer must be one of the other choices.

C: Let's think step-by-step.

The bills for each telephone company will be the same when the charges for each company are the same. So we want to find out when the charges for each company are equal.
We can set up the equation:

0.25x = 6.00 - 12.00
0.25x = -6.00
x = -24.00

This doesn't make sense, because the number of minutes can't be negative. So the answer must be one of the other choices.
