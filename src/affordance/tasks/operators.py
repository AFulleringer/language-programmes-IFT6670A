A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to understand what the op operator does. It subtracts j from i.
Next, we need to apply that operation to the numbers given.

i op j subtracts j from i.

A: Let's think step-by-step.

The op operator keeps the 3 first digits of 125690.

A: Let's think step-by-step.

The op operator suppresses the j first digits of i. In this case, j is 2. This means that the first 2 digits of 125690 will be suppressed.
125690
The first 2 digits are 12, so they will be suppressed.
5690

A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first number in the list is 16. The next number is 0.
16 is greater than 0, so the op operator will select 16.
The next number is 10. 16 is greater than 10, so op will select 10.
The next number is 6. 10 is greater than 6, so op will select 6.
