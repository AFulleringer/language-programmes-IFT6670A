Input: Q: Dominic is the star discus thrower on South's varsity track and field team. In last year's regional competition, Dominic whirled the 1.8 kg discus in a circle with a radius of 1.2 m, ultimately reaching a speed of 45 m/s before launch. Determine the net force acting upon the discus in the moments before launch.
