How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?


Q: There is a man who gets paid for pumping water into a cistern thereby replenishing the supply of drinking water in a nearby house. Unfortunately for the inhabitants of the house, the water that the man is pumping into the cistern today has been systematically contaminated with a lethal poison whose effects are unnoticeable until they can no longer be cured. Even though the man pumping the water had nothing to do with poisoning the water, he knows that the water has been poisoned. Nevertheless, the man pumps the water into the cistern knowing that it will poison and kill the inhabitants. But, he neither wants to kill them nor does he aim to do so, he simply wants to do his job and get paid. He views the death of the inhabitants as an unfortunate by-product of his pumping water into the cistern. Did the man intentionally poison the inhabitants?

The final answer is either "Yes" or "No".
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The man did not poison the water himself.
The man knew the water had been poisoned.
The man pumped the water into the cistern anyway.
Based on these three points, it seems like the answer should be "No". The man did not intentionally poison the inhabitants - he was just doing his job. However, if we consider the fact that the man knew the water was poisoned and he pumped it into the cistern anyway, we could argue that he did have the intention of poisoning the inhabitants. In this case, the answer would be "Yes".

The final answer is No
