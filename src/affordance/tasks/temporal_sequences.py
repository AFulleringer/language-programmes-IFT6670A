The amusement park was closed after 10pm.
Between what times could Elizabeth have gone to the amusement park?
  choice: 7am to 1pm
  choice: 9pm to 10pm
  choice: 1pm to 2pm
  choice: 3pm to 6pm
A: Let's think step by step.
Wake-up time: 7am.
7am-1pm: free.
1pm-2pm: fixing their computer at the electronic store.
2pm-3pm: playing tennis at the tennis court.
3pm-6pm: walking towards the Statue of Liberty.
6pm-9pm: taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.
9pm-10pm: getting a coffee at the cafe.
The amusement park closure time: 10pm.
The only time when Elizabeth could have gone to the amusement park was 7am to 1pm. So the answer is 7am to 1pm.

Q: Today, Tiffany went to the beach. Between what times could they have gone?
We know that:
Tiffany woke up at 5am.
Betty saw Tiffany getting a coffee at the cafe from 5am to 6am.
Jessica saw Tiffany working at the office from 6am to 9am.
John saw Tiffany stretching at a yoga studio from 9am to 12pm.
Sean saw Tiffany sitting on a rooftop from 12pm to 2pm.
Sarah saw Tiffany playing tennis at the tennis court from 2pm to 3pm.
The beach was closed after 4pm.
Between what times could Tiffany have gone to the beach?
  choice: 9am to 12pm
  choice: 12pm to 2pm
  choice: 5am to 6am
  choice: 3pm to 4pm
A: Let's think step by step.
Wake-up time: 5am.
5am-6am: getting a coffee at the cafe.
6am-9am: working at the office.
9am-12pm: stretching at a yoga studio.
12pm-2pm: sitting on a rooftop.
2pm-3pm: playing tennis at the tennis court.
3pm-4pm: free.
The beach closure time: 4pm.
The only time when Tiffany could have gone to the beach was 3pm to 4pm. So the answer is 3pm to 4pm.
